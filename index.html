					“Rescue the perishing
					<br>
					don’t hesitate to step in and help.
					<br>
					If you say, “Hey, that’s none of my business,”
					<br>
					will that get you off the hook?
					<br>
					Someone is watching you closely, you know—
					<br>
					Someone not impressed with weak excuses.” <br>- <i>Proverbs 24:11-12</i>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p class="letter">I wanted to thank you for all of your support, and for every single grain of passion that you have invested into God’s Kingdom and into this ministry.  At the same time, I wanted to make a petition, with all the love and gratitude there is, of course. Lately I've been reflecting on the value of devotion— the value of being united until the end.
	<br>
	<br>
	In this walk with those that are marginalized, in this battle against injustice, in this community full of oppression— but in which Jesus is always present—many people have offered or promised to be at our side in this battle, which is something that we are very thankful for.
	<br>
	<br>
	Those of you who have chosen to walk with us represent such a great diversity of points of view, gifts, talents, opinions, where every single one of us can and should be who they were supposed to be, in order to contribute what no one else would be able to contribute but themselves. Above everything else, we are grateful for those of you who are so willing to give your time through your powerful and valuable prayers.
	<br>
	<br>
	My prayer for you is that your heart would be filled with love for God, that you would be filled with God’s love for you, and that you would keep moving forward with us—with the love Paul talked about in Corinthians 13.
	<br>
	<br>
	For God's love and justice: "Let's keep going" no matter what, and let's hope that everything that comes our way keeps us united. Thank you for everything, and let's keep up with this, because God and thousands of people are waiting and counting on our "yes".
	<br>

	<i>Such a medicine is love,</i>

Silent Images is a nonprofit organization that provides charities with professional photography and video services that educate and inspire viewers to give, go, and pray. They have provided us with high quality photography, and a short film that helps to communicate the focus of our work with the La Limonada community.

				<h1>Local Suport in Guatemala</h1>
				<p class="silent1">
				For most Guatemalans, La Limonada is a notorious place known only for danger and theft. Though visible from main roads and located in the heart of Guatemala City, it is largely ignored and avoided. Despite this, many city residents have started to see through these narratives, considering the children and families who live, work, and play there. And in recent years they have begun to partner with Vidas Plenas in their community development work. University students, local doctors, and other professionals have made contributions of time, money, and trade-specific skills. A local food company has also provided consistent donations of rice and beans. It is beautiful to see the barriers of marginalization begin to crumble as various Guatemalans commit to walk alongside their brothers and sisters in La Limonada.

					<h2>Education</h2>
					<img src="img/program-1.jpg">
					<img src="img/program-2.jpg">
					<p class="block">Over the past five years, there has been a transformation toward higher standards and we continue to move in that direction where we are more fully embracing a call to make a lifelong impact in the lives of the students we serve and in families throughout the community. We continue to work to provide the best training for the team so that the children receive the best education for their whole lives.
					</p>
					<h3>Education Development Report</h3>
					<p class="block">The academies in La Limonada are offering educational support to the children at the physical, educational, emotional, and spiritual levels. There is always plenty of food to ensure that the children are well fed. The children are taught about healthy eating and the importance of nutrients for their physical development. They are also given vitamins and are expected to brush their teeth, encouraging proper hygiene habits.
					</p>
					<p class="block">
Each day, the teachers plan lessons in the areas of reading, writing, mathematics, and social studies. Along with academic instruction, the teachers infuse character values and Bible stories into their schedules. They encourage the children to think about how their actions affect themselves and others. They discuss the importance of values such as respect, responsibility, and teamwork. Examples of these values are highlighted in interactive children’s books and Bible stories, outlining exemplary people who have demonstrated strong character.
					</p>
					<p class="block">
	Further emotional and spiritual support is offered daily as teachers take time for house visits. During this time, they deliver food, visit homes of children who are struggling, pray for sick family members, and much more. They seek to serve the students and their families in every way possible, and have incredibly passionate and devoted hearts for meeting the needs of others.
					</p>
					<p class="block">
There is no doubt that the teachers in the academies are influential agents of change in the La Limonada community. While it is obvious to see the love the teachers have for the children within the school buildings, there is evidence that this expands into their home life as well.

					<h2>Safe Home</h2>
					<img src="img/program-3.jpg">
					<img src="img/program-4.jpg">
					<p class="block">Thanks to the work of a psychologist who works one-on-one with each of the 19 children at the Safe Home, all of them are in the process of leaving behind the trauma of physical abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect. Thanks to the staff members who serve there, the children are truly provided with a “safe haven”, and a loving home to call their own.
					</p>
					<p class="block">
Tita met one of the boys who lives at the home when he was eight years old. At the time he was holding a shotgun, which the gang members in the community were teaching him to use. It was clear that the gangs were grooming him to be one of their own because he had been given the same nickname as the leader of the gang. Now, he is 16, and Tita says, “he reads his Bible, and he is an amazing gentleman”.
					</p>
					<p class="block">
Speaking about one of the girls at the Safe Home, Tita said, “she has no one who would take her in. No mom. No dad. No one. She has a very rough story; it’s hard and painful to hear. But now, she is a princess. She has big dreams, and a beautiful, thankful heart.”
					</p>
					<h3>Report from Safe Home Psychologist</h3>
					<p class="block">
Because of the confidence,  approval, and unconditional love the kids have found in the support system, the healthy experiences their new environment provides; and of course, and the mercy and grace of God, their worldview is starting to be restructured.
					</p>
					<p class="block">
The fruit is starting to “spring forth”… I know for certain that most of the children have achieved (and some are on their way):  hope for their future, a new sense of belonging, a new and healthier notion of “family”, a healthier self-value and self-acceptance, freedom to be different, vulnerable, and honest, and to learn and grow through making mistakes.
					</p>
					<p class="block">
In the end, we are clear that it is not our job to change these children, but to guide them, teach them, and walk with them. The real change comes from God.

In the microenterprise program we were able to finish the year serving 27 people compared to 17 we started with. During this year we trained people in basic financial concepts like savings and budgeting. In one of the sessions, we talked about setting saving goals. We also talked about how to save more money by spending money wisely and following a budget. With all this in her mind, one of our clients, Maria Isabel,  set her savings goal to the amount it would cost to remodel her house. At the time, it was January and she set out to reach her goal by June. From what she learned through the lessons on savings, she was able to reach her savings goal by April. I believe the lessons on savings have the most impact on the clients, as most of them had no savings before being a part of the program.
					</p>
					<p class="block">
In the vocational training program we continued to work with the women that are part of it.  We continued to work in partnership with Women at Risk International, and we also developed a new partnership with the <a href="http://therootcollective.com/" class="hov2">The Root Collective</a> for whom the ladies make upcycled PET bottle necklaces. We also started organizing our operations better keeping a better control of the inventories of material and finished products. One of the women in the program is now in charge of keeping these records.

			<h1>From the <br class="temp">Board of Directors</h1>
			<img src="img/slide-11.jpg">
			<p class="block">
			In April 2013, my family and I had the privilege of visiting La Limonada. We were captivated by the community, to say the least. The experience of seeing God at work among the people of La Limonada led us to sponsor a young girl and her mother, whom we met on the trip. We saw first-hand that life change is happening one relationship at a time and consider it a special opportunity to get to play a small part.
			</p>
			<p class="block">
After returning home, we continued to pray for the work being done and relational bridges being built in La Limonada. My children often asked me for updates on the people of the community. Imagine my family's joy when I was invited to serve on the Lemonade International board! It is a blessing to us to hear updates, pray for, and invest in the ministry happening in La Limonada every day.
			</p>
			<p class="block">
Thank you from the bottom of my heart to those of you who are investing time, money, and prayer into La Limonada. God is doing a restorative work in La Limonada, and every effort matters. Nothing is wasted, and it all brings glory to God.
